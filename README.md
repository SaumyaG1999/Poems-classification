## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Kaggle's data to :
 1. Classify the poems dataset into the different genres.
 2. To analyse the accuracy of the 2 different classifiers on the dataset.
 
## File Description
   There is a jupyteer notebook available which will help you to guide through the above questions 
## Results
   With the help of label encoder and TfidfVectorizer, features were easily extracted and was able to classify the data.
   Used Random forest classifier and naive-bayes classifier to classify the data .
